## Features & Usages

#### 1. Syntax highlighting for temme files

#### 2. Runnig temme selectors directly from vscode

Method: Command palette -> Temme: Run temme selector

Before running temme selectors directly from vscode, you need to have some tagged-links in temme file.

#### 3. Watch mode

Method: Command palette -> Temme: Start watching

In watch mode, every time the selector changes, the result will be re-calculated automatically. Only one watching task can be active at a time. Before you start another task, the active watching task will be cancelled automatically.

This extension will recognize pattern `// <tag> path` in temme files. When the cursor is at lines which contain tagged-link, vscode will provide some the following code actions. Tagged-link is required if you want to run temme selectors in vscode.
